            <h3>Chess</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(0, 87, 114); border: 1px dotted rgb(0, 87, 114); padding: 9px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25; margin: 20px;">
            Chess is one of the oldest and most respected board games in the world. It is played between two 
            players on a board of 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins with sixteen 
            pieces that include pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, a queen, and a king, each moving in its own unique 
            way. The aim of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king, which means putting it under attack with
            no way to escape. Chess is often described as a battle of minds, where logic, planning, and strategy 
            play the most important role. It helps develop memory, problem-solving skills, and patience, making it
            more than just a game. Throughout history, chess has been linked with intelligence and competition, and
            today it is played casually at homes, in clubs, and in international tournaments. Many countries also 
            include chess in schools to help students improve their concentration and critical thinking abilities.

            <h3>Ludo</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(67, 44, 95); border: 1px dotted rgb(67, 44, 95); padding: 9px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25; margin: 20px;">
            Ludo is a colorful and exciting game that is loved by people of all ages. It is based on an ancient 
            Indian game called Pachisi, which has been played for centuries. Ludo is played between two to four 
            players, and each player has four tokens that must move from the starting area to the finishing point.
            The movement of tokens depends on the roll of a die, which makes the game both fun and unpredictable. 
            A token can only start moving when the player rolls a six, and tokens can be captured and sent back to 
            the starting point if they land on the same square as another player’s piece. The thrill of escaping 
            captures and racing to the finish makes Ludo very engaging. Although it depends largely on luck, smart 
            planning and timing also help players win. Ludo is simple to learn and brings families and friends 
            together, which is why it remains one of the most popular household games around the world.

            <h3>Scrabble</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(0, 87, 114); border: 1px dotted rgb(0, 87, 114); padding: 9px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25; margin: 20px;">
            Scrabble is a word-building game that combines knowledge of language with strategic thinking. It is 
            played on a 15x15 board where players place letter tiles to form words horizontally or vertically. 
            Each letter has a score, and players try to create high-value words to outscore their opponents. 
            Special squares on the board, such as double letter scores or triple word scores, make the game even 
            more challenging and rewarding. Scrabble not only entertains but also educates, as it improves 
            vocabulary, spelling, and critical thinking skills. Players must carefully choose where to place their
            words, both to gain maximum points and to block their opponents. It is played casually at home, in 
            classrooms as a learning tool, and even in competitive tournaments at national and international levels. 
            The game is so influential that it has become a favorite for people who love language and puzzles, and 
            it continues to remain a timeless classic for both education and fun.

            <h3>Monopoly</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(67, 44, 95); border: 1px dotted rgb(67, 44, 95); padding: 9px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25; margin: 20px;">
            Monopoly is one of the most famous property-trading games ever created. It is usually played between 
            two to six players who compete to buy, sell, and manage properties on the board. The objective is to 
            become the wealthiest player by collecting rent from opponents who land on your properties. Players 
            move around the board by rolling dice and face a variety of experiences, such as going to jail, paying 
            taxes, or winning rewards from community chest and chance cards. The excitement comes from buying 
            entire sets of properties and building houses and hotels to increase rent value. Monopoly is both 
            competitive and unpredictable because it combines luck from dice rolls with smart decision-making and 
            negotiation skills. It also teaches lessons about money management, risk-taking, and the importance of 
            planning ahead. Over the years, Monopoly has been released in many special editions based on cities, 
            movies, and cultures, making it not just a game but also a collectible.

            <h3>Carrom</h3>
            <p style="color: rgb(0, 87, 114); border: 1px dotted rgb(0, 87, 114); padding: 9px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25; margin: 20px;">
            Carrom is a traditional board game that is very popular in South Asia and other parts of the world. 
            It is played on a square wooden board with four corner pockets. Players use a heavier disk called a 
            striker to flick lighter pieces known as carrom men into the pockets. The goal is to pocket all your 
            pieces before your opponent, but you must also pocket the red queen disk to win completely. Carrom 
            requires not only accuracy and skill but also strategy, since players need to plan their moves while 
            defending against their opponents. It is usually played between two or four players, and it is common 
            to see it played in homes, clubs, and local tournaments. The game is social and entertaining, but it 
            also sharpens hand–eye coordination and focus. Carrom boards come in different sizes, and tournaments 
            often use larger professional ones. For many families, carrom is more than just a pastime; it is a 
            tradition passed down through generations, bringing people together in friendly competition.
